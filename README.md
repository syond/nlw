## :floppy_disk: Installation

Before you start, you need to clone the repository using `git clone`.

1. Now we need to install the dependecies of the server, web, and mobile. Inside each one folder you'll run: `npm install` or `yarn install`.

2. Now we need to configure the enviroments variable. Inside each project folder you'll see a `.env.example` file, rename it to just `.env`, open each one and configure with your informations.

3. Ok! Now server project has a specific configuration, just run the following commands inside the server folder:

    - `npx knex migrate:latest (to run migrations)`
    - `npx knex seed:run (to run seeds)`

4. Just run `npm run dev` for Server, and `npm start` for Web and Mobile. 

Ps: During the `npm start` execution in Mobile, remember to accept expo-cli installation when appears.

Now you are ready to go! :)
